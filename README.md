# Power Consumption Prediction with Load Disaggregation
Developed and compared LSTM and PTPNet models to predict appliance-level energy consumption using the UK-DALE dataset. Improved model performance through data augmentation, attention mechanisms, and deeper architectures, and optimized results with hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and testing different optimizers.
